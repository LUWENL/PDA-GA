> Abstract: The advancement of satellite constellation surveillance technology has catalyzed the emergence of autonomous mission scheduling and execution as a focal point of scholarly inquiry in recent years. While prior investigations predominantly concentrated on static target observation, the exigency to transition task allocation and execution from static ground targets to time-sensitive moving targets has underscored a notable gap in the existing literatureâ€”a lack of a comprehensive system for realizing the task allocation and execution of multi-satellite for moving targets tracking.Addressing this exigency, this paper introduces a rapid yet efficacious satellite constellation task allocation method, termed the Parallel Dual Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (PDA-GA), for tracking multiple moving targets. Specifically, based on the a meticulous analysis of the relevant factors needed to be considered in real tracking scenarios, we propose PDA-GA, with the help of the parallel mechanism and dual adaptive mechanism, which can improve the search efficiency of the task allocation solution. Meanwhile, the proposed PDA-GA for task allocation stage, combined with the autonomous attitude control algorithm for tracking stage, is tested in simulated dynamic tracking scenarios, showcasing its remarkable tracking performance.In addition, to facilitate high-fidelity simulation of tracking scenarios, we introduce the Constellation Target Tracking Environment (CTTE) with a physics engine, incorporating algorithms facilitating multi-satellite task allocation and single-satellite attitude control.This work can inform future research efforts related to autonomous tracking of multiple time-sensitive moving targets in constellations.
